Students Knowledge Hub for peer learning.


In many public secondary schools across Africa, students often struggle to get quick answers to their study questions. 
Whether it’s understanding a tricky math concept, solving a science problem, or needing advice on study techniques, there’s a gap in accessible, student-friendly resources. 
EduConnect aims to solve this by creating an open platform where students can ask questions, share knowledge, and help each other grow academically. This tool is inspired by platforms like Quora but tailored specifically for students. It will be a space where they can engage, learn from their peers, and feel empowered to ask and answer questions freely. The platform will encourage a community of learners helping each other succeed while also building a habit of collaborative learning. Core Features 
1. Ask & Answer: Students can post questions in different subjects (e.g., math, science, literature). Other students can answer these questions, share explanations, or suggest study resources. 
2.Upvotes & Badges: Students can upvote helpful answers, encouraging quality content. 
3.Subject Categories & Search: Questions are organised by subject categories (e.g., math, biology, history) for easy browsing. 
4.A search bar allows students to quickly find specific topics or questions.
5. There is an attachment button on the questions and anwers field where charts and illustrations can be added to clarify or reference questions and answers
